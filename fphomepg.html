<h1> One Size Fits All
</h1>
<h2>Beauty doesn't have a size tag.</h2>
<h3>
One Size Fits All was created because we see a need to empower women and girls, we also wanted to discuss the issues we see in our corners.  Our first corner is make-up there we discuss how make-up is okay, and issues we have with make-up in general and certain companies. Our next corner is body shapes we wanted to show all body shapes and sizes are okay everone does't have to have the small waist and wide hips. Lastly  we call our last corner the hue corner because we want to show that all skin shades are beautiful.
