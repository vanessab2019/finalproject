<h4> Many brands and companies are known for there models with perfectly symmetrical faces. These models lead to a nonrealistic image of what beauty actually is. These companies have big influence on many women but especially adolecent girls. Adolecent girls or teenage girls often get influenced by big companies like Victoria's Secret, girls look at there pictures and ads everywhere. Since these girls see the models everywhere they get influenced and think that they should have a perfect and symmetrical face like a model to be beautiful. Although these models are in reality beautiful it doesn't mean that a model's beauty is the only type of beauty that exists. Many girls fail to understand that, model's get pounds of makeup on ther faces and often times get photoshopped. Even these models can't achive this look by themselves, what a models shows in a magazine or on media is all artificial beauty</h4>
