<h1>One Size Fits all</h1>
<h2>The Hue of You</h2>
<p>The hue of you is based off of women of a particular color and how they may have very low confidence because of the color of their skin. Women now believe that just because they are of a certain that background, that they should be hated for it, abused by it, and also discouraged by it and that's the reason this page was created to help women specifically of color find their beauty and their inner confidence. Women go through so much and we want to take whatever burden there is and make them feel better about themselves and confident in their own skin. I also use this to stop the stereotypes that women get on a daily basis. They get stereotyped for their color, their body, and so much more to the point they start to bully themselves and have so much haterd built up inside and that can lead to many things such as suicide for a prime example. We want our women in this world to feel good about themselves and not feel ashamed because of their appearance or the color of their skin. We are all equal and that's how we should be treated in this world.
